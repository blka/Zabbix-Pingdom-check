This script was created to be used by Zabbix to check the status of a Pingdom check. It could be expanded to other uses fairly easily.

You will need to get an App-Key from your Pingdom account, and obtain the check's ID number. I did this using the API calls, but can add that in later.

(insert instructions on getting check ID)
